X chris's anim
X   use markers
X   use animation

X map ui: 
X   render light earth tiles
X   render dark earth tiles for dark bg
X   render uk mask tiles
X   composite animation
X   start on a tight zoom
X   only fetch tiles if exist (non existence hash)
    clustering overlapped pins?

music player:
X popup
X insert soundcloud player
X insert mixcloud player
X style player with decent css
  player stays playing when browsing?
X pan to include player bounds if player popup outside of view
X move player popup out of leaflet: opacity issues, z-index issues
X make soundcloud anim more efficient (dirty movement flag from map)
  prefer to appear in a space where there aren't pins

X timeline ui:
X   buttons
X   slider (with resize to fit)
X   time label
X   markers w/ some kind of  animation to match timeline
    pins matching time change icon?
    pins not matching time get smaller or disappear?
X   hold mouse down on button moves slider value over time

X zoom ui:
X   buttons
X   slider

ui interaction:
X   bug: slider only draggable if moused over exactly
    touch events - make sure ipad works
    ipad too slow - do something

  text:
X   use font
X   sideways title
X   bug: render rotated title text on canvas rather than html text to avoid crummy aliasing
X   bug: make sure font loads before using it in canvas (firefox bug) 
X   popups: open
X   popups: have filled pattern tails
X   popup: tails: svg clipping unreliable in firefox, use canvas instead
X   popups: close others when opening
X   add: form
    add set: post to api
    add set: drag map marker to location
X   add set: google geo api?
X   share
X   about


extra:
X   white ui when bg is dark
X   move build scripts out of web dir
    move all leaflet edits out of leaflet source, so that minified and current leaflet can be used
    url changes to show current set
X   background animation
    map: other layers
          names
          roads, streams
    hide ui on small screens
    black text is sometimes hard to read over animation
X   more efficient compositing ideas:
X         composite in larger blocks
X         only redo mask layer if moved/resized/zoomed
